  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <h4>How do you generate data?</h4>
  <p>To generate the data, I'm using
    <a href="http://www.simulationcraft.org/" target="blank">SimulationCraft</a> and its standard profiles with my own tool, which is called
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloodmallet/bloodytrinkets" target="blank">Bloodytrinkets</a>. All limitations applying to SimulationCraft apply to these graphs as well.</p>

  <h4>Can I trust your charts?</h4>
  <p>Yes-ish - for a rough overview. Your own equipment, legendaries and talents change the value of items and traits for your
    character. Therefore, simming your own character is the most effective way to know which performs best. The easiest way
    to do so is by heading to
    <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot" target="blank">RAIDBOTS</a>, which uses SimulationCraft for you.</p>

  <h4>What SimulationCraft settings do you use?</h4>
  <ul class="sim-settings" type="square">
    <li>fight_style:
      <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki/RaidEvents" target="blank">patchwerk and beastlord</a>
    </li>
    <li>fight_length: 300sec</li>
    <li>target_error: 0.1% for trinkets and 0.08% for crucible (patchwerk) and 0.25% for trinket and 0.2% for crucibles (beastlord)</li>
    <li>fixed_time: on</li>
    <li>optimize_expressions: on</li>
    <li>default_actions: on</li>
    <li>ready_trigger: on</li>
    <li>ptr: off</li>
    <li>tmi_boss: TMI_Standard_Boss_T19M</li>
    <li>tmi_boss_type: T19M</li>
    <li>all not-mentioned settings use SimulationCraft default values</li>
    <li>base profiles:
      <a href="http://www.simulationcraft.org/reports/T21_Raid.html" target="blank">T21</a> (the DfA rogue profile and protection paladin dps profile were used in place of the base profiles)</li>
    <li>a versatility stat stick at ilevel 910 was used in conjunction with the ones in the graph</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Why do you use a versatility stat stick?</h4>
  <p>Because not using a second trinket is unrealistic and the stat/damage loss might be able to somehow affect other trinkets.
    I'm aware that many trinkets are able to affect each other and my hope is that a versatility stat stick affects all trinkets
    for all specs roughly equally. If you have other thoughts or ideas, please let me know.</p>

  <h4>Why did you include the legendary trinket Kil'jaeden's Burning Wish?</h4>
  <p>Because there are some sad souls out there, who just got their first or second legendary and got that trinket. For everyone
    else: the legendary trinket doesn't really compete with other trinkets but with other legendaries, because we're only
    allowed to equip two at the same time. So the "power" of this trinket is somewhat misleading, if you have to unequip
    a different legendary.</p>

  <h4>Why did you use beastlord?</h4>
  <p>I chose beastlord because it's a standard add fight style in SimulationCraft and in my opinion currently allows the best
    look at m+ dungeons and very add heavy fights from all baseline fight styles. Please be aware that m+ trash fights are
    much shorter than the used time for these sims.</p>

  <h4>Why is there a disclaimer about beastlord?</h4>
  <p>Because I can't stress the weaknesses of beastlord simulations enough. Beastlord simulations suffer from multiple weaknesses
    and their graphs should be taken with a huge boulder of salt. The standard profiles are most likely optimized for single
    target; itemwise (legendary effects and secondaries) and talentwise. As I don't change either it's very much possible
    that the results you see here, don't reflect the potential for your spec. In addition it's possible that the standard
    APL does not consider AoE fights. Make sure to check out your theorycrafters resources!</p>

  <h4>Why are timewalking trinkets missing?</h4>
  <p>Because the graphs have enough entries as is, and the chance to get them are quite rare. Please simulate your own character
    with those trinkets yourself to see how well they perform.</p>

  <h4>Why is X non-timewalking trinket missing?</h4>
  <p>Chances are, I simply overlooked it. Please contact me via
    <a href="https://discord.gg/tFR2uvK" target="blank">SimCMinMax Discord</a> (channel: #bloodytools) or
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloodmallet/bloodmallet.github.io/issues" target="blank">GitHub - bloodmallet.github.io Issues</a> and create an issue there. I'll make sure to add it to the programm and therefore
    will add it with the next redoing of the charts to the website.</p>

  <h4>Why do you do this?</h4>
  <p>Because I wrote this automatation tool (
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloodmallet/bloodytrinkets" target="blank">GitHub - Bloodytrinkets</a>) and like to run it. And I figured...why not share the results?</p>

  <h4>Where can I submit spelling errors/improvements?</h4>
  <p>Please use the issue system of the repository for this website.
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloodmallet/bloodmallet.github.io/issues" target="blank">GitHub - bloodmallet.github.io Issues</a>
  </p>

  <h4>I want to poke you, how am I able to contact you?</h4>
  <p>The easiest way would be to join the
    <a href="https://discord.gg/tFR2uvK" target="blank">SimCMinMax Discord</a>. Head to the #bloodytools channel. Writing there will make sure that I'll see it. My nickname
    is Bloodmallet(EU)#8246.</p>

  <h4 id="support">Is there a way to support you?</h4>
  <p>There really is no need to support me. But if you like this resource and want to
    <a href="https://www.paypal.me/bloodmallet" target="blank">make a gift via paypal</a>, you can do so. But please be aware that I'm doing this for fun and for free.</p>
